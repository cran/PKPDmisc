read nonmem files easily

\details{
This function is designed specifically for handling nonmem's nonstandard output format, and
is especially useful for simulation tables output with NSUB as it will appropriately parse out
the additional TABLE and column name rows.

HOWEVER, for tables with standard formatting (eg comma separated with FORMAT=,1PE11.4) and
no NSUB, then the `read_phx()` function will likely be slightly faster. This should only be an issue
for large (at least 20 MB) files, else the difference will be imperceptible.
